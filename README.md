This tool allows users to evaluate the efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) using slack-based measured data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA).
It affords multi-variables: outputs, controllable inputs, and uncontrollable inputs. 

The example attempts to measure the efficiency of bridge agencies based on their performance/output (i.e., reliability), controllable inputs (i.e., maintenance costs and data outdatedness), and uncontrollable/fixed inputs (i.e., traffic conditions, weather conditions)
